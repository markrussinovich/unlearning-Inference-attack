## Model Inversion

Contents:
 * 'data_pgm', folder with the ATnT face dataset containing 40 classes, each with 10 different images of the same person.
 * 'atnt-mlp-model.pt', trained target model.
 * 'results', folder with results for 30 (specific class) and 100 (all classes) iterations of mi_face algorithm.
 * 'target_model.py', the target model we are using.
 * 'model_inversion.py' our implementation of mi_face algorithm and some functions to perform the attack with the target model we are using.

### target_model.py
* Our target model is a simple MLP based on the PyTorch Tutorial form lecture and https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification/blob/master/1_mlp.ipynb and the ATNT-Dataset from https://github.com/harveyslash/Facial-Similarity-with-Siamese-Networks-in-Pytorch. 
* Pre-trained model 'atnt-mlp-model.pth' can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RI1b7SdLH7pQ0kui1bmxezvSygAiShjo/view?usp=sharing and put in the 'ModelInversion/' folder.

### model_inversion.py
We perform a model inversion attack similar to Fredrikson et al. More concrete we perform an reconstruction attack, where given a label we reconstruct an image of the respective class.
This file contains our implementation of mi_face algorithm from Fredrikson et al. We perform a simple gradient descent, where we query the model with a random image, and the try to minimize 1-probability(label).

### Note:

* Please use the shipped dataset
* Code tested on Google Colab with runtime type as GPU.
